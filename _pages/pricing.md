We offer two luxurious experiences that are simply priced *without any hidden fees* for a stress free and relaxing experience.


## Packages
Unlike most photographers, our boudoir packages **include** digital images and a full print release for any delivered photo. We won't try to upsell you after the shoot. 

Each package also includes an 8x8 photo album, valued at $99, which makes a perfect gift!
