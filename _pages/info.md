## Why boudoir?
Boudoir is about much more than just a few sexy photos.  Boudoir is empowerment.  Itâ€™s about taking a moment to appreciate yourself.  Your boudoir experience will leave you feeling confident and beautiful. We want you to fall in love with yourself.

We will be with you every step of the way. We will listen and make your shoot uniquely yours, help you select your wardrobe and accessories, and show you exactly how to pose. Give the gift of a lifetime - an album full of amazing photos of YOU - and be ready to fall in love with yourself!

## Is boudoir new?
While boudoir dates back to the 1840s, it has never been more popular than it is now!

## Why do people do a boudoir shoot?
* As a gift. Boudoir photos are a very unique and personal gift for someone special. Boudoir photos are an amazing bridal gift and they make a fantastic anniversary or Valentine's Day gift.  

* Just Because. Treat yourself! Every woman should have a boudoir album that reminds them how beautiful they are.  

* To celebrate a special occasion. Maybe you've recently accomplished a fitness goal or gotten back into shape. Whatever the goal, celebrate your hard work.

## How does your process work?
1. When you contact us we will reach out to schedule a free, *no pressure* consultation with you. During the consultation we will design the perfect session for you. We will cover all the details including:
* Your unique wants and goals
* Wardrobe, hair, and makeup
* Location
* Date and time

2. About one week before your shoot you'll get an email with some reminders and tips, so you're packed and ready to go for your shoot.

3. On the day of your shoot we will guide you through your session from start to finish. Your only job is to relax and enjoy the experience.

4. You'll receive a secure digital album with your images to review, typically in 2-3 weeks (rush service is available). Our shoots include full print and digital rights to those images.

5. Our shoots include an album that we design. We will ask you a few questions to customize your album.  It will be delivered to your house in 1-2 weeks.

6. We will happily supply you with lab quality prints for an extra, but not extravagant, fee.

## What if I don't know how to pose and I'm not a model?
No one comes in knowing how to pose. That's our job! You certainly don't need to be a model either.  We've shot women of all ages, shapes, and sizes. We'll help you pose, and you'll leave looking amazing and feeling confident. Your only job is to relax and enjoy the experience, we'll handle the rest! 

## Will my photos be on the internet?
Only if you want them to be. Your shoot includes a password protected, TLS encrypted digital album that you control access to. If you don't want your photos on the internet whatsoever, that's fine as well.  We can deliver your images on a USB flash drive.
