              <p class="text-white mb-4 text-left">

                Wherever we collect sensitive information (such as credit card data), that information is encrypted and transmitted to us in a secure way. You can verify this by looking for a lock icon in the address bar and looking for "https" at the beginning of the address of the Web page.</p>

The computers/servers in which we store personally identifiable information are kept in a secure environment.</p>
